			<dfn><a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suositteluj%C3%A4rjestelm%C3%A4" target="_blank">Recommender systems</a></dfn> are widely seen as an effective means to combat <dfn>information overload</dfn>, as they help us both narrow down the number of items to consider (e.g. by suggesting books we are likely to find interesting) and decide which item(s) to choose (e.g. which book(s) to buy). In effect, they are seen as helping us make better decisions at lower transaction cost. Consequently, RS have become omnipresent in e-commerce and are also increasingly used in services in various other domains both online and offline where the number of items exceeds our ability to consider them all individually.

			The research on recommender systems has largely focused <u>on evaluating them in system-centric terms while ignoring user-centric aspects</u>. This approach is now seen as having been detrimental to the field, as recommenders that are excellent in system-centric terms are not necessarily the ones that actually serve their users the best. Today, it is widely acknowledged that, while algorithmic aspects are important, it is <strong>the user-centric factors that <del>make-or-break a recommender system</del></strong><del> by determining its adoption and use</del> <strong>determine the adoption and use of recommender systems</strong>.
			</p>		
	<h2 id="publications">Publications</h2>
		
		The publications that constitute this dissertation focus on user-centric aspects of recommender systems in three domains. We look at:
		
			<ul>
				<li>How actual users find and choose items on Amazon, the pioneering e-commerce player (<strong>Publications I</strong> and <strong>II</strong>)
				</li>
				<li>What kinds of underlying dynamites dynamics are involved in news recommending (<strong>Publication III</strong>)
				</li>
				<li>Various issues involved in employing recommender systems in e-learning, using a system that we designed and implemented (<strong>Publications IV–VII</strong>)
				</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p>
		All studies, except Publication III that is a survey study, involve actual users using actual systems in authentic use context. Also, in all studies except III, we collected both subjective data (interview or questionnaire data) and observation data (over-the-shoulder observation or use log data), allo
		wing us to minimize the effects of the say-do problem. Consequently, the publications offer us windows into the actual use of recommender systems in the context of the wholes of the services (rather than focusing on isolated aspects in exclusion of the whole).
		</p>
		<blockquote><em>“While the explorative nature of the studies does not always allow us to generalize the results widely, the studies provide us with views of the actual use dynamics that have received little research attention thus far, due to the difficulties involved in studying them.”</em></blockquote>
		
	<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
		<p>
		The results underline that there are few universal truths as far as user-related factors in recommender systems are concerned. In fact, what is true in one context can be the opposite in another context due to changing user tasks and goals. For example, while minimizing user effort in eliciting preferences is often used as a guideline for e-commerce (so as not to distract users from their current activity), in e-learning the same process represents a learning opportunity not to be wasted. In fact, increasing the cost and complexity of evaluating items in e-learning appears to enhance honesty, learning, and user experience. Also, as motivations behind dishonesty are different in e-commerce and e-learning, engendering positive behavior in various domains needs to be tackled differently. Moreover, recommender systems and the complex contexts where they are employed easily lead to emergent behavior that is hard to predict. Consequently, in developing recommender systems that truly serve their users, user-centric testing is a must.

		<pre><code>
		&lt;table border="1"&gt;
		   &lt;caption&gt;Otsake taulukolle&lt;/caption&gt;
		   &lt;tr&gt;
		      &lt;th&gt;Otsikkosolu 1&lt;/th&gt;
		      &lt;th&gt;Otsikkosolu 2&lt;/th&gt;
		      &lt;th&gt;Otsikkosolu 3&lt;/th&gt;
		   &lt;/tr&gt;
		   &lt;tr&gt;
		      &lt;td&gt;Sisältösolu otsikon 1 alla&lt;/td&gt;
		      &lt;td&gt;Sisältösolu otsikon 2 alla&lt;/td&gt;
		      &lt;td&gt;Sisältösolu otsikon 3 alla&lt;/td&gt;
		   &lt;/tr&gt;
		   &lt;/table&gt;
		</code></pre>
		
		<p>
		In addition, while recommender systems have been subject to intense research interest, there are competing definitions of what the term <dfn>recommender system</dfn> actually comprises. We review existing definitions of the concept and discuss their various merits, as well as the consequences of adopting them. In effect, we argue that the technology-centered definition of recommender systems unnecessarily limits the recommender system research, while a wider definition allows us to consider all facets of recommender systems<sup>1</sup>.
